## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up D1 Database
1. Create a new D1 database:
```bash
npx wrangler d1 create greenlight
```

2. You'll receive output like this:
```
‚úÖ Successfully created DB 'greenlight' in region WNAM
Created your new D1 database.

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "greenlight"
database_id = "bbf2cf65-3e81-4a04-bab5-21e673e1dbb0"
```

3. Copy the provided configuration into your `wrangler.toml` file under the `[[d1_databases]]` section.

### 3. Set Up KV Storage
1. Create the main KV namespace:
```bash
npx wrangler kv:namespace create "app_state"
```

2. Create the preview KV namespace:
```bash
npx wrangler kv:namespace create "app_state" --preview
```

3. You'll receive output like this for the main namespace:
```
üåÄ Creating namespace with title "greenlight-app_state"
‚ú® Success!
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "app_state"
id = "468881005e4d48dc8a2a0b9436b10ac3"
```

4. And for the preview namespace:
```
üåÄ Creating namespace with title "greenlight-app_state_preview"
‚ú® Success!
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "app_state"
preview_id = "622c246f2dc84eb6b389fa2a850f710d"
```

5. Combine both outputs in your `wrangler.toml`:
```toml
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "APP_STATE"
id = "468881005e4d48dc8a2a0b9436b10ac3"
preview_id = "622c246f2dc84eb6b389fa2a850f710d"
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.dev.vars` file for local development:
```env
# JIRA Integration
JIRA_BASE_URL=       # JIRA instance URL (e.g., https://your-domain.atlassian.net)
JIRA_USER_EMAIL=     # JIRA user email for API access
JIRA_API_TOKEN=      # JIRA API token for authentication

# Email Notifications
NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_TO=  # Comma-separated list of notification recipients
NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_FROM= # Email address to send notifications from

# Authentication
ROOT_USERS=           # Comma-separated list of root user emails
```

### 5. Configure Email Routing in Cloudflare
1. Go to your Cloudflare dashboard and navigate to "Email" > "Email Routing"
2. Enable Email Routing if not already enabled
3. Configure routing rules:
   - Add your sender address (configured in `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_FROM`) as a custom address
   - Add destination addresses (matching `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_TO`) as verified recipients
4. Test the email routing by sending a test email

### 6. Development
Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 7. Deployment
Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:
```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Routes** (`routes.js`): Handles HTTP requests and coordinates business logic
- **Auth** (`auth.js`): Manages user authentication and authorization via middleware
- **Database** (`database.js`): Handles all database operations with transaction support
- **Email** (`emailNotifications.js`): Manages HTML email notifications with ticket details
- **JIRA** (`jiraIntegration.js`): Handles JIRA API integration and ticket validation
- **UI** (`ui.js`): Contains all UI components and rendering logic with HTMX integration

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main dashboard page
- `GET /api/releases` - Get list of releases (HTML fragment)
- `POST /api/releases` - Create a new release
- `DELETE /api/releases/:id` - Delete a release (root users only)
- `GET /api/validate-jira/:ticketKey` - Validate a JIRA ticket in real-time

## Database Schema

The application uses two main tables with soft delete support:

### Releases
```sql
CREATE TABLE releases (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  release_date DATE NOT NULL,
  status TEXT CHECK(status IN ('GO', 'NO_GO')) NOT NULL,
  explanation TEXT,
  created_by TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_by TEXT,
  updated_at DATETIME,
  deleted_at DATETIME,
  deleted_by TEXT
)
```

### Excluded Tickets
```sql
CREATE TABLE excluded_tickets (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  release_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  ticket_key TEXT NOT NULL,
  ticket_summary TEXT,
  ticket_url TEXT,
  created_by TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (release_id) REFERENCES releases(id)
)
```
